# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned React Components and decoupled a website into components.

**Thoughts:** With much excitement, I was able to decouple repeatitive elements and make components of them which could be invoked in any other page. Examples include making a component called Header, Footer etc... And can be imported to the other pages.
