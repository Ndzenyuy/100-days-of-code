# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned React Components and decoupled a website into components.

**Thoughts:** With much excitement, I was able to decouple repeatitive elements and make components of them which could be invoked in any other page. Examples include making a component called Header, Footer etc... And can be imported to the other pages.

### Day 3: December 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned React event handling, adding functions to elements hook data to a variable as it is typep with useState and add elements to an array after a user submits

**Thoughts:** I was able to attach react components  to events, the app picks the data selected by the user and handles accordingly via a function.
